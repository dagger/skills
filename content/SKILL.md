description: Run, set up, and write Dagger 1.0 checks, generators, services, and modules. Use when the repository has dagger.toml, dagger.json, or dagger-module.toml, or when the user mentions Dagger, dag:// links, or Dagger Cloud.

# Dagger

Dagger is CI. It runs the same checks before push (`dagger check`) and after
push (Cloud Checks). Checks run as functions in containers. Modules run native
tools, such as `go test` or ESLint, and read their native configuration, such as
`go.mod`.

## When to use it

- `dagger.toml` exists: use `dagger` instead of native tools to build, test,
  lint, and generate.
- Only `dagger.json` exists: it is Dagger 0.x configuration. Dagger 1.0 runs it.
  Migrate only when the user asks.
- Only `dagger-module.toml` exists: the repository is a module. Read
  [write-a-module.md](write-a-module.md).
- No file exists: set up Dagger only when the user asks.

## Read first

Dagger 1.0 is different from 0.x. Do not trust your memory.

- Before each task in "Tasks", read its docs page. Do not skip this for setup.
- To find other pages, read https://docs.dagger.io/llms.txt. Do not use web
  search results or blog posts.
- For toolchain guides, such as Go or ESLint, and CI migration guides, read the
  "Guides" list of https://dagger.io/llms.txt. Add `.md` to a guide URL to get
  Markdown.
- For commands and flags, read `dagger COMMAND --help`. If the docs and the CLI
  disagree, follow the CLI.

## Terms

- **Workspace**: a directory with `dagger.toml`, usually a Git repository.
  `dagger.toml` lists the installed modules and their settings.
- **Module**: a package of functions. Its manifest is `dagger-module.toml`.
- **Setting**: a value for a module constructor argument.
- **Check**: a function that passes or fails, such as a test or a linter.
- **Generator**: a function that returns a changeset (proposed file changes).
- **Collection**: a set of artifacts (typed objects, such as Go packages or test
  files) that a module finds at run time. Each collection adds a flag to select
  artifacts.
- **DAG link**: the `dag://` address of a check, generator, service, or
  artifact. To list links, add `-l -a -f link` to `dagger check`, `generate`, or
  `start`. For the syntax, read `dagger help links`.

## Tasks

| Task | Start with | Docs (docs.dagger.io) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Set up a workspace | `dagger init` | /getting-started/quickstart |
| Add a module for a tool | `dagger module recommend`, `dagger module search TOOL` | /reference/modules |
| Give project tools or services to a module | Read [write-a-module.md](write-a-module.md) | /config/module-wiring |
| Change module settings | `dagger module settings` | /config |
| Run checks | `dagger check -l` | /using/checking |
| Run generators | `dagger generate -l` | /using/generating |
| Start services | `dagger start -l` | /using/services |
| Call a function | `dagger api functions` | /using/calling-functions |
| Run checks after each push to GitHub | `dagger cloud checks on` | /cloud-checks |
| Move from another CI | Read the guide for that CI | /cloud-checks |
| Write a module | Read [write-a-module.md](write-a-module.md) | /reference/sdks |
| Migrate from 0.x | `dagger workspace migrate` | /migrate-to-v1 |

After setup, stop when at least one check runs. Tell the user which modules you
installed and which commands run them.

Cloud Checks run checks only. Put each deploy or release step in a function of
the dev module, not in a check. The existing CI or the user calls it with
`dagger api call`. When you move from another CI, keep the old jobs. Remove a
job only after its checks give the same results.

## Command rules

- To apply a changeset, add `-y`. To preview it, add `--no-apply`.
- Ask the user before a `dagger cloud` command that changes Cloud configuration.
  If a step needs a browser, such as login, tell the user to do it.
- Do not use `dagger agent`, `-i`, or `dagger shell` without `-c`. They need an
  interactive terminal. `dagger shell FUNCTION -c 'COMMAND'` runs COMMAND in the
  container that FUNCTION returns.
- Run `dagger check` with a long timeout. Run `dagger start` in the background,
  because it does not exit. Give `dagger start` a service name or a collection
  flag.
- If a setting value starts with `-`, put `--` before it, such as
  `dagger module settings go goflags -- -tags=extended`.
- If the engine does not start on the local machine, report the error. Do not
  change `DAGGER_ENGINE` unless the user asks.
- Pass secrets as URIs, such as `env://TOKEN`. Do not put secret values in files
  or commands. Put other values in native configuration or settings, not in host
  environment variables.
- Do not add logic that skips checks for unchanged files. The cache skips repeat
  work.
- Commit `dagger.toml`, `dagger.lock`, and the module directories, such as
  `.dagger`.

## Verify a change

1. Before the change, run `dagger check`. Report failures. Fix them only when
   the user asks.
2. After the change, run the affected checks. Select them with a DAG link or a
   collection flag, such as `--go-package=PATH`.
3. Run `dagger check` again. Fix new failures until no new check fails.

A skipped test does not fail its check. If the report shows skipped tests, look
for a missing service.

## Fix a failure

- If you are logged in to Dagger Cloud, read the failure with
  `dagger cloud traces view --last` or `dagger cloud traces view URL`.
- Check link ends with `/stale`: run `dagger generate -y LINK`, where LINK is
  the check link without `/stale`. Do not edit generated files.
- File not found: the check sees only the files that its module includes, not
  the whole workspace. To include the file, read the toolchain guide and the
  module page.
- Other check failure: find a fix function with `dagger api functions MODULE`,
  or read the module page under https://docs.dagger.io/reference/modules.
- Run the failed check again by its DAG link.
- Command fails without a clear cause: compare `dagger version` with
  https://docs.dagger.io/getting-started/install. Tell the user if the CLI is
  older. Suggest `dagger lock update` if `dagger.lock` pins old versions.
